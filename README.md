# NLP-Learnings
A first step on the road to learning Natural language Processing and rediscovering long lost passion for language. : )

The repository contains the following tasks for evaluation under my mentor, Prof. Sharmila Banu
```
1. Task1:- Downloading Anaconda Navigator in our laptops and getting familiar with Jupyter
           (Please note my version of MARKDOWN definition)
           
2. NLP_T2:- It was a beautiful website that not only indicated spelling and grammatical errors but also pointed out
           adverb count and use of CLICHÃ‰. Though it may not seem much to a novice linguist, it can be used by
           *the head of a fictitious magazine before RECRUITING a new employee to check the originality in ideas and 
           not traditional un-plagiarized content by apps like spin bot etc.*

3. Task3:- File has been uploaded as HTML. Notice how first time I encountered and overcame errors in JUPYTER 
           notebook while exploring Brown, Webtech and Gutenberg Corpus

4. Task4:- Parts of speech tagging. I began realizing how powerful NLTK was.

5. Task5:- Explored Lexicon stopword for 2 language enlish and french. Also performed NLTK pipelining on my favourite
           actor Shah Rukh Khan : )
           
6. Task6:- Lemmatization and CounterVectors
           It was fun to discover words which trick our lemmatizers and where they beat us back
           
7. Task7:- If you go through this repository, PLEASE CHECK OUT THIS FILE: 
                                 Authors_writing_style_comparison_using_COSINE_SIMILARITY
           This has been my favourite task of all till now. Why? Because it is a proof that my fav. author is genuinely good : )
