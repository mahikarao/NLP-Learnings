# NLP-Learnings
A first step on the road to learning Natural language Processing and rediscovering long lost passion for language. : )

The repository contains the following tasks for evaluation under my mentor, Prof. Sharmila Banu
```
1. Task1:- Downloading Anaconda Navigator in our laptops and getting familiar with Jupyter
           (Please note my version of MARKDOWN definition)
           
2. NLP_T2:- It was a beautiful website that not only indicated spelling and grammatical errors but also pointed out
           adverb count and use of CLICHÃ‰. Though it may not seem much to a novice linguist, it can be used by
           *the head of a fictitious magazine before RECRUITING a new employee to check the originality in ideas and 
           not traditional un-plagiarized content by apps like spin bot etc.*
